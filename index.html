        <p>
          Hello, my name is Bosco! I'm a student at Code Lousville. In about 24
          weeks I will have the skills and knowledge to be hired as a Junior Web
          Developer.

        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I will code for bacon and biscuits. I like to eat at the table with
          humans as I don't bite. I demand that my employer trim and even polish
          my nails so that I always look professional. No matter how adorable I
          appear, I'm never getting another hair cut! Baths will be subject to
          my human's approval, since it depends on her taste buds and soap since
          she got a mouth full during her last try. I require two (2) fifteen
          minute walks and one (1) sixty minute nap during my work day. Rub my
          belly and I'm your friend for life ... unless you have a cat. Oh, I
          can be quite clumsy and have been known to fall from my chair while
          typing or get tangled in computer cords and accessories when running
          around to alleviate my frequent boredom. Well, enough about me as all
          you really need to know is that I'm lovable and most importantly,
          AVAILABLE. Yes, you're going to hire me. Thank you for listening,
          looking forward to working with you, and please think about giving me
          a diamond collar for my excellent ninety (90) day performance review.

            Fall over dead (not really but gets sympathy). Intently stare at the
            same spot, sleep on my head. Rub face on owner whenever a door is
            opened, rush in before the human. I shredded your linens for you,
            then love you.

          <p>
            I may bark at the vacuum cleaner and chew up shoes, but I'll always
            show my love for you by licking your face, acting like you've been
            away for a month even when it's just been an hour, and cuddling you
            on the sofa.

            Enormous rawhide bone, growl at other dogs, run and hide under the
            bed until treats are fed. Sit and stare with my dark brown eyes, but
            sleep on that comfy dog bed. Pet my belly, you know you want to;
            seize your hand and shake it! All with a waging tail.
